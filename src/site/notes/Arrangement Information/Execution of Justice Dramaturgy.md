Hello! This will be a repository for dramaturgical + probably projections research for [[Cast/Execution of Justice\|Execution of Justice]]. It is still a work in progress. Thank you for checking it out!

If you are looking for a more guided history & context, please check out [[Arrangement Information/Crash Course\|Crash Course]]. This page is well-linked and will serve as a structured jumping-off point for exploring the resources I've gathered. Otherwise, please start at the page for [[Cast/Execution of Justice\|the show]] and go from there!

On every larger page, content is organized into multiple sections. For each page, reading **all passages that are bolded** will give you the most important information. 

Where possible, I've cited the location of sources. Every source I've looked at is (hopefully) linked in the [[Arrangement Information/Bibliography\|bibliography]]. If you would like any more information about any topic please don't hesitate to reach out!
