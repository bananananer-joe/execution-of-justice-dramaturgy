For solely *my ease of reference*, sources are cited on pages with the following order of priority: 
1. last name of author (page number)
2. first name of author (page number)
3. organization name (link)
4. website name (link)
If the same source has multiple unique references, I will number them before the page number. e.g Shilts 2 (33-34)

The below is an alphabetical list of sources used. For websites that have multiple webpages cited, I'm still figuring out an organizational system.
