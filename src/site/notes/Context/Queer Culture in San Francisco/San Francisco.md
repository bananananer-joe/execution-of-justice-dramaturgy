In 1964, Life magazine declared San Francisco as "The Gay Capital of the World." If it wasn't true then, it was certainly true by the time Execution of Justice takes place. A lot of reasons have led to its development as a queer mecca, and this page will give a short outline of the reasons why.

#### Pre World War II Queerness in the Bay

A founding myth of California talks about the Amazonian Queen Califia[^1][^2], and her name "had become a part of lesbian folklore by the 1970s." 

Walt Whitman's poetry saw California as the westward future of America. His poem "A Promise to California", set in the Calamus cluster of poems in *Leaves of Grass*, advocates for "homoerotic male love as the emotional tie that could best bind the fractious states."

Even earlier than Whitman's time, queerness was present as two-spirit people in Native tribes. Female masculinities have existed for a long time outside of Western cultures, but were foreign ideas to the Catholic priests who followed the path of the conquest of North America.

Although two-spirit and gender variance is not prevalent in all native tribes, it does have a presence in the Ohlone, the principle tribe indigenous to the Bay Area. [[Terms/Lesbianism\|Lesbianism]] was also a "unremarkable aspect of conventional female sexuality" [^3]

What the Europeans could not understand they decried, and called non-conformative individuals terms such as "berdache" (literally boy prostitute), "mujerado," "jolla," or "hermaphrodite."

As California began to be more settled during the Gold Rush, records grow sparser. Victorian sensibilities about sex, an absence of records, and **homosociality** as the norm makes it hard to have a clear grasp on queer culture. Friendships were often between the same sex anyways, and many purely social behaviors would be considered homoerotic by today's lens. Additionally, social conventions made bisexuality the norm. Limited economic freedom and social expectations for women almost necessitated participating in traditional marriage. Financial freedom allowed gay men to have exclusive homosexuality before lesbians.

Crossdressing was also not stigmatized back then, nor was it restricted to drag, butch, or trans subcultures. Parades, costume balls, and vaudeville would commonly feature female impersonators, in the same way that racial impersonation was unobjectionable.

In the mid-19th century, the brothels along Barbary Coast earned San Francisco the nickname "Sodom by the Sea," quickly replacing the earlier "Baghdad by the Bay." It's rumored that the [[Context/Queer Culture in San Francisco/Hanky code\|hanky code]] originated in all-male square dances held by miners[^4].

Prohibition killed a lot of gay culture, but as those laws began to get repealed, [[Context/Gay Bars\|gay bars]] began to open up as private public spaces for queer socialization. The 1930s were also the beginning of [[Bathhouses\|bathhouse culture]] and [[Cruising\|cruising]].

###### Notable People & Places
- Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas, one of the most famous lesbian couples in history, both grew up in San Francisco.
- Harry Hay, founder of the [[Context/Organizations of Relevance/Mattachine Society\|Mattachine Society]] was a openly gay Stanford student involved in the CA [[Terms/Opera & Theatre\|theatre]] circuits
#### World War II

**Perhaps the single biggest contributor to San Francisco's position as a queer mecca was [[World War II\|World War II]]. During WWII, gay and lesbian service members would be outed and dishonorably discharged for their sexualities and would find themselves in San Francisco.**

Dishonorable discharges, known as "blue discharges" for the blue slips onto which a massive "H" was stamped, granted their holder a *persona non grata* status. Publicly outed, many discharges opted to stay in California for a better life.

Gay culture flourished, and the government began to crack down. Homosexuality became the next public target after 
#### 1879 Time Capsule

A time capsule had been buried in front of a statue in Washington Square with the instructions to open in 100 years. On April 22, 1979, [[Cast/Main Figures/Dianne Feinstein\|Dianne Feinstein]] opened the capsule and revealed the contents[^5].  Amidst [temperence tracts](https://cdm17521.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/temperance), newspapers, and photographs was a pamphlet titled *The Great Geysers of California, and How to Reach Them* by Laura De Force Gordon.

> *If this little book should see the light after its 100 years of entombment, I would like its readers to know that the author was a [[Terms/Lesbianism\|lover of her own sex]] and devoted the best years of her life in striving for the political equality and social and moral elevation of women.*

After the capsule was opened, a new capsule was placed with relevant cultural material of the times[^6][^7]such as:
- A pair of Levis
- A poem by Lawrence Ferlinghetti (the city's poet laureate)
- A bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon
- A record by the Hoodoo Rhythm Devils
- A copy of *Tales of the City* by Armistead Maupin
- Local menus from Julius’ Castle, La Veranda, Guido’s and Savoy Tivoli
- Leggs pantyhose
- Birth control pills
- A Bic lighter
