##### 1879 Time Capsule

A time capsule had been buried in front of a statue in Washington Square with the instructions to open in 100 years. On April 22, 1979, [[Cast/Main Figures/Dianne Feinstein\|Dianne Feinstein]] opened the capsule and revealed the contents[^1].  Amidst [[https://cdm17521.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/temperance\|temperence tracts]], newspapers, and photographs was a pamphlet titled *The Great Geysers of California, and How to Reach Them* by Laura De Force Gordon.

> *If this little book should see the light after its 100 years of entombment, I would like its readers to know that the author was a [[Lesbianism\|lover of her own sex]] and devoted the best years of her life in striving for the political equality and social and moral elevation of women.*

After the capsule was opened, a new capsule was placed with relevant cultural material of the times[^2][^3]such as:
- A pair of Levis
- A poem by Lawrence Ferlinghetti
- A bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon
- A record by the Hoodoo Rhythm Devils
- A copy of *Tales of the City* by Armistead Maupin
- Birth control pills
