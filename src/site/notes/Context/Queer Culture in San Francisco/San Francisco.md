##### 1879 Time Capsule

A time capsule had been buried in front of a statue in Washington Square with the instructions to open in 100 years. On April 22, 1979, [[Cast/Main Figures/Dianne Feinstein\|Dianne Feinstein]] opened the capsule and revealed the contents. 

After the capsule was opened, a new capsule was placed with relevant cultural material of the times[^1]:
