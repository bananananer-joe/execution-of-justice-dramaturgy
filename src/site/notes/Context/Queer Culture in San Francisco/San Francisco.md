##### 1879 Time Capsule

A time capsule had been buried in front of a statue in Washington Square with the instructions to open in 100 years. On April 22, 1979, [[Cast/Main Figures/Dianne Feinstein\|Dianne Feinstein]] opened the capsule and revealed the contents[^1]. 



After the capsule was opened, a new capsule was placed with relevant cultural material of the times[^2] such as:
- A pair of Levis
- A poem by Lawrence Ferlinghetti
- A bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon
- A record by the Hoodoo Rhythm Devils
- A copy of *Tales of the City* by Armistead Maupin
