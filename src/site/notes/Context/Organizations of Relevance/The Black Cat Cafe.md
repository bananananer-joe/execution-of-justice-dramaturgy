*The San Francisco bar, not to be confused with [[Context/Organizations of Relevance/The Black Cat Tavern\|The Black Cat Tavern]].*

The Black Cat Cafe was a [[Context/Gay Bars\|gay bar]] that was open from 1906-1921, and 1933-1964. It served as a focal point of queer culture in San Francisco. Originally opened by Charles Ridley, it was purchased by Sol Stoumen in the 1940s.

Stoumen turned it into the center of bohemian and Beat culture. Frequented by authors like Jack Kerouac, Steinbeck, Saroyan, and Ginsberg, it eventually began to attract a gay clientele. Ginsberg said it was

> "the best gay bar in America. It was totally open, bohemian, San Francisco...and everybody went there, heterosexual and homosexual....All the gay screaming queens would come, the heterosexual gray flannel suit types, longshoremen. All the poets went there." [^1]

The bar featured live entertainment, its main attraction being Jos√© Sarria. Sarria wore drag and performed one-man operas. He had two main slogans: [^2]
- "There's nothing wrong with being gay-- the crime is getting caught."
- "United we stand, divided they catch us one by one."

He would routinely lead choruses of "God save us nelly queens" to cheer up gay prisoners in overnight detention at the prison across the street.  

Sarria's antics made the Black Cat a target of the police. the Alcohol Beverage Control Commission (ABC) tried to shut down the bar, because serving alcohol to homosexuals was a criminal offence. Stoumen, the bar's owner & a straight man, took the case to court, and in a landmark case [*Stoumen v Reilly*](https://scocal.stanford.edu/opinion/stoumen-v-reilly-29515) said "[in] order to establish 'good cause' for suspension of plaintiff's license, something more must be shown than that many of his patrons were homosexuals and that they used his restaurant and bar as a meeting place."

This made police target the bar more, and a fifteen year effort to shut down the bar began. Gay bars across the city set up an information network to keep each other safe and warn of any possible plainsclothes policemen or ABC investigators.

[[Events/Halloween\|Halloween]] was the one exception to the cop's assaults, and the chief of police reportedly escorted Sarria in drag to North Beach.

In 1961, Sarria ran for the board of commissioners. Although he lost the election, it was the first time an openly gay candidate had run for public office, and he managed to get a non-insignificant 6000 votes. It was the first time the gay community had come out to vote, and his bid cemented the gay voting bloc's power in the minds of San Francisco candidates.

After 15 years of fighting against the ABC, Stoumen finally conceded the fight. Black Cat employees had already been forgoing paychecks to keep up the legal battles to keep the store afloat, and local fundraising wasn't going anywhere. They lost their liquor license the day before Halloween, 1963, and closed permanently in February 1964. After the Black Cat closed down, many gay bars followed. The police and ABC closed five more the following week; and of the thirty gay bars open that final Halloween, only 18 remained by 1964.

It's closure led to the formation of the [[Context/Organizations of Relevance/Society for Individual Rights\|Society for Individual Rights]], a gay organizing effort that partnered with liberal church leaders to form the Council on Religion and the Homosexual. Working together with the Mattachine, DOB, SIR, and other groups, they organized a [1964 New Years' Eve benefit](https://www.sfgate.com/opinion/article/the-night-san-francisco-s-sense-of-gay-pride-2572316.php). It was the first gay rights case the ACLU were involved in, and led to a LGBTQ police liaison.
