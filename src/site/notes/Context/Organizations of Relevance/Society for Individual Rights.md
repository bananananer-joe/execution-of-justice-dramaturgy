Founded after [[Context/Organizations of Relevance/The Black Cat Cafe\|The Black Cat Cafe]] closed, the SIR organized a [1964 New Years' Eve benefit](https://www.sfgate.com/opinion/article/the-night-san-francisco-s-sense-of-gay-pride-2572316.php) in tandem with local ministers (*see [[Context/History of Queer Organizing#After The Black Cat Cafe's Closure\|here for more]]*). After the benefit and its ensuing trial, their membership soared as they organized social dances for the gay community. Reaching 1,200 members by 1967 [^1], candidates for public office began visiting SIR meetings to campaign, starting with Jack Morrison.

Support of the SIR was essential in [[Cast/Main Figures/Dianne Feinstein\|Dianne Feinstein]]'s 1969 supervisor campaign.

SIR's political chairman Jim Foster became one of the faces of the SF queer community. In 1971, he founded the [[Context/Organizations of Relevance/Alice B. Toklas Memorial Democratic Club\|Alice B. Toklas Memorial Democratic Club]] to better organize the SIR's political committee into a dedicated group.
