#### After The Black Cat Cafe's Closure
The [[Context/Organizations of Relevance/The Black Cat Cafe\|Black Cat Cafe's]] closure led to the formation of the [[Context/Organizations of Relevance/Society for Individual Rights\|Society for Individual Rights]] (SIR), a gay organizing effort that partnered with liberal church leaders to form the Council on Religion and the Homosexual. Working together with the [[Context/Organizations of Relevance/Mattachine Society\|Mattachine]], [[Context/Organizations of Relevance/Daughters of Bilitis\|DOB]], SIR, and other groups, they organized a [1964 New Years' Eve benefit](https://www.sfgate.com/opinion/article/the-night-san-francisco-s-sense-of-gay-pride-2572316.php). It was the first gay rights case the ACLU were involved in.

On the day of the actual function, police had staked out the hall's entrance with bright lights and were taking photographs of anyone who entered. Fifty uniformed and plainsclothes officers stood nearby to come charging in at a moment's notice. Despite their presence, over five hundred gays and lesbians attended the event.

Organized in tandem with heterosexual ministers, the police presence opened the eyes of San Francisco to the struggles homosexuals faced on a daily basis. The ministers held a press conference in response to the police presence, and were key witnesses in the trial that followed. Cecil Witness, a prominent Black civil & LGBT rights activist, was a new member of clergy at the time.

The jury voted unanimously in the gays' favor, and led to the establishment of a gay liaison to the SFPD. The incident also empowered SIR to hold larger community events, and made it a political entity that local candidates began approaching for votes.
