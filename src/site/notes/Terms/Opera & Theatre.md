Opera and theatre have long since been linked to homosexuality and queerness. For the sake of simplicity, I'll be referring to theatre as an all-encompassing term for theatre & opera for this article, but will clarify where needed.

A 1966 Time Article on *"The Homosexual in America"*[^1] is one of the earlier mentions of homosexuality in the news. Importantly a very [[Terms/Homophobia\|homophobic piece]], it notes:

> On Broadway, it would be difficult to find a production without homosexuals playing important parts, either onstage or off. And in Hollywood, says Broadway Producer David Merrick, "you have to scrape them off the ceiling." 
> ... 
> But in the theater, dance and music world, deviates are so widespread that they sometimes seem to be running a kind of closed shop. Art Critic Harold Rosenberg reports a "banding together of homosexual painters and their nonpainting auxiliaries."

Theatre was a place for queer misfits to find like company. It let them express themselves and put on stories
