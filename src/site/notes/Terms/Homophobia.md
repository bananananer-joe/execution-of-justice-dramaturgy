##### Early Homophobia

The 60s and 70s were a homophobic place. Being gay or lesbian was considered deviancy, and public sentiment against it quickly escalated into a moral and religious panic. Some of the earliest few pieces of reporting on queerness were Life's *Homosexuality in America*[^1] (1964) and TIME's *The Homosexual in America*[^2] (1966).

Life had reached out to Hal Call, leader of the [[Context/Organizations of Relevance/Mattachine Society\|Mattachine Society]], and featured two gay bars (the Tool Box and the Jumping Frog). Call said it was "the first time a national magazine had ever treated the subject of homosexuality with any sensitivity or understanding" [^3]. At the same time, the article generalized homosexuality and warned readers that the 'gay world' is "actually a sad and often sordid world."

The Life article talked uncritically of the frequent [[Cast/Main Figures/Police Force#Entrapment\|police entrapment efforts]] that went on in bars and included the psychoanalyst Dr. Beiber's opinion that homosexuals are "psychologically sick, the emotionally disturbed offspring of emotionally disturbed parentsâ€™."

Despite its flaws, the Life article attempted to accurately portray the reality of queer culture in San Francisco. The TIME article, on the other hand, focused on queerness as deviancy. It pushes the idea that homosexuality "is caused psychically, through a disabling fear of the opposite sex." The article pushes a Freudian narrative to explain both homosexuality and lesbianism. 

Here is the beginning of the religious attack on gayness, as TIME mourns that "the clear-cut condemnations of the Bible or of traditional moral philosophy have come to be considerably toned down." 

Interestingly enough, TIME mentions the 1963 statement by British Quakers that "homosexual affection can be as selfless as heterosexual affection" and is not necessarily a sin. Possibly one of the first faith based affirmations of gay equality, it was a landmark moment in history.[^4]
